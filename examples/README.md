#IDEPI example-based tutorial

Please look inside the daughter folders for examples on how to use IDEPI to 
learn and apply phenotype prediction models based on viral sequences and to 
identify most predictive features of viral genomes.

A preprint of the paper describing IDEPI is included in this folder as well. 

* **DRAM** : study HIV-1 drug resistance association mutations 
* **tropism** : develop models and classify HIV-1 co-receptor usage based on V3 sequences
* **dementia** : learn genetic signatures in HIV-1 env associated with dementia
* **bnab**: identify epitopes of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies
