IDentify EPItopes README
=====================

IDEPI is a domain-specific and extensible software library for supervised
learning of models that relate genotype to phenotype for HIV-1 and other
organisms. 

IDEPI provides a programming interface to allow users to engineer sequence
features and select machine algorithms appropriate for their application.

 
For the impatient
=================

A virtual machine has been created with Ubuntu 13 and python environment for
use with idepi located at https://github.com/veg/idepi/releases/new

Virtual Machine Credentials : 
- user: user
- password: reverse


Dependencies
============

Depending on which parts of Biopython you plan to use, there are a
number of other optional Python dependencies - which can in general
be installed after Biopython.

- Python 3.3
- BioPython, http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page
- BioExt, http://github.com/veg/BioExt 
- hppy, http://github.com/veg/hppy
- sklrmmr, http://github.com/nlhepler/sklmrmr
- NumPy, http://www.numpy.org 
- six, http://pypi.python.org/pypi/six


Using IDEPI
=================
Please look inside the <code>examples</code> directory for examples of how
to use IDEPI to learn and apply phenotype prediction models based on viral
sequences and to identify most predictive features of viral genomes.
